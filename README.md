# Multi-label-Image-Classification

"I developed and deployed a deep learning model for multilabel image classification, distinguishing it from traditional binary and multiclass approaches. Unlike binary (one of two classes) or multiclass (one of multiple classes) classification, this model simultaneously evaluates each image against multiple categories, assigning a probability to each class. This is achieved through the integration of several independent binary classifiers, each responsible for predicting the presence or absence of a specific class within an image. For instance, rather than simply classifying an image as 'Cat' or 'Dog', the model assesses and assigns probabilities for both 'Cat' and 'Not Cat' classes, enabling the accurate identification of images that contain multiple objects or attributes."
